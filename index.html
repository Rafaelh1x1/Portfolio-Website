      What's up! Welcome to my portfolio page! This is where I showcase all the
      things that I have worked on, and some stuff that is still a work in
      progress, and you can also learn a bit about me as a developer and as a
      person!

    <p class="who-am-i-section section">
      As a developer, I have experience working with a lot of front-end
      technologies, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, all that jazz. Besides that I also
      have experience with relational databases systems using MySQL. I’ve
      studied Java, C++, and python, but I haven’t used those languages to make
      anything crazy yet.

      This was a prototype website I created for my sister's Jewelry business,
      Sam N Silver. I designed the main landing page, developed some
      functionality for it, and optimized the website so it looked good on
      various screen sizes. The project was a sandbox for me to master
      fundamental CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

    <p class="work-in-progress-description project-description">
      I have various other projects that I am working on and designing still but
      it might be a little or long time until those ever get released but keep
      an eye out they are going to be pretty neat if I do say so myself!
